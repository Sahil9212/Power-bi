📊 Data Science Salary Dashboard

This project presents a Data Science Salary Dashboard that visualizes salary trends across various dimensions such as job title, experience level, company size, and company location. The dashboard provides valuable insights into global data science compensation patterns.

📁 Project Overview

The dashboard aggregates and analyzes salary-related fields to help understand how salaries vary across:

Job roles

Experience levels

Company sizes

Geographic locations

Salary currencies

This helps analysts and stakeholders identify compensation trends and make data-driven decisions.

🖼 Dashboard Highlights
1. Salary Metrics

Total Salary Sum: Displayed prominently as 60M

First Salary Currency: BRL

Progress Bar: Represents aggregated salary sum

Semi-Dial Visualization: Showcases salary distribution for a smaller range (up to 7M)

2. Filters

Experience-level slicer includes:

EN (Entry level)

EX (Expert)

MI (Mid-level)

SE (Senior-level)

This allows users to dynamically explore salary distribution across different experience categories.

3. Salary by Company Size

A line chart showing:

Highest salaries paid by large (L) companies

Moderate salaries by medium (M) companies

Lowest salaries by small (S) companies

4. Salary by Company Location & Currency

A donut chart visualizing:

Salary distribution between countries (e.g., MX, TR)

Percentage contribution, e.g.,

720K (80%)
